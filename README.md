# ECOS_visualizations


This project was for Chapman's Grand Challenges Initiative.

The goal of the project was to research effectiveness of alternative soaps and alternative sponges for doing dishes. Take a look at the final poster (Team ECOS Poster.png), this will give a more in depth and broad explanation of the project.

The code and analysis here showcases my ggplot2 ability in R to make custom visualizations that are of publishable quality.

Data comes from two sources: from a qualitative questionnaire which asks respondents which plate is cleanest as well as quantitative analysis which used the remaining sauce weight on each plate.
